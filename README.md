## About This Project

This book is built using [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), a tool for creating online books from Markdown files. The content is organized in the `src` directory, with each chapter as a separate Markdown file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of Markdown

### Working with the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd prompt-engineering-handbook
   ```

2. **Preview the book locally**:
   ```bash
   mdbook serve
   ```
   This will start a local server (usually at http://localhost:3000) where you can view the book.

3. **Edit content**:
   - All content is in the `src` directory
   - Each chapter is a separate Markdown file (e.g., `chapter_1.md`)
   - The table of contents is defined in `src/SUMMARY.md`
   - Update `src/SUMMARY.md` when adding new chapters

4. **Build the book**:
   ```bash
   mdbook build
   ```
   This creates a static site in the `book` directory.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Contains all the Markdown files for the book
- `src/SUMMARY.md` - Defines the book's structure and navigation
- `src/TOC.md` - Detailed table of contents

- `book.toml` - Configuration file for mdBook

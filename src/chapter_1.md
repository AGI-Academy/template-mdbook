# Chapter 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

## 1.1 What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions to guide large language models (LLMs) toward producing desired outputs. It involves designing, testing, and refining the text inputs that users provide to AI models to achieve specific results. In essence, prompt engineering is the bridge between human intent and machine understandingâ€”a critical skill in the era of generative AI.

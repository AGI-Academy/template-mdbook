# Prompt
I'm writing a comprehensive book on prompt engineering based on this (table of contents)[../src/TOC.md]

Could you please write the complete content for section [SECTION NUMBER]: [SECTION TITLE]?

I'm looking for:
- Thorough, educational content appropriate for a textbook chapter
- Clear explanations with examples where helpful
- Practical insights that readers can apply
- References to current research or best practices where relevant
- Approximately 800-1200 words (adjust as needed for the specific section)

Please format the content with appropriate headings, paragraphs, and bullet points for readability.

## Build Commands
- No specific build process required for markdown documentation
- Use `mdbook serve` for local preview if mdbook is installed
- Document changes can be verified with markdown linters

## Style Guidelines
- Follow mdbook markdown format
- File organization: chapters in `src` directory, with chapter_1.md format
- Heading structure: use `#` for main titles, `##` for sections, `###` for subsections
- Lists: use `*` for bullet points, consistent indentation for nested lists
- Code blocks: use triple backticks with language specification
- Links: use relative paths between documents with markdown format `@text`
- Keep line length reasonable (under 100 characters)
- Maintain consistent spacing between sections
- Use clear, descriptive filenames that match content headings
